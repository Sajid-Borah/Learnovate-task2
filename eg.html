            <p>Geology is the science of earth's crust (lithosphere) consisting of rocks and soils. While mining and mineralogical engineers are more interested in rocks, their petrology (formation) and mineralogy, civil engineers are equally interested in soils and rocks, in their formations, and also in their properties for civil engineering design and construction. This book is so written that the subject can easily be taught by a civil engineering faculty member specialised in soil mechanics.</p>
